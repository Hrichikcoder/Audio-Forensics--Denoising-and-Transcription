# ===== EXECUTIVE SUMMARY =====
doc.add_heading("Executive Summary", level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "This report documents the forensic analysis and recovery of a deliberately jammed WWII-era "
    "radio interception audio recording named 'war-intercept.wav'. "
    "The audio was subjected to intentional Continuous Wave (CW) jamming at two primary frequencies: "
    "700 Hz and 2600 Hz, along with their mathematical harmonics at 1400 Hz and 2800 Hz. "
    "These jamming tones completely masked the underlying voice recording, rendering it "
    "unintelligible to the human ear in its raw state.\n\n"
    "Using a two-stage custom Python audio processing pipeline, the jamming tones were surgically "
    "removed using STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) Spectral Deletion — a technique that "
    "treats the audio as a 2D frequency image and erases the jamming columns directly, "
    "completely avoiding the resonance 'ringing' artifacts caused by traditional IIR filters. "
    "The cleaned audio was then passed through AI-powered Spectral Noise Reduction (noisereduce) "
    "to eliminate residual tape hiss, and a 15x dynamic compression boost was applied to raise "
    "the voice to a clearly audible level.\n\n"
    "The final cleaned audio was transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper AI (small model), "
    "revealing the content to be a personal letter from a WWII soldier named Charlie, "
    "dated December 30, 1942, describing having Christmas dinner with Queen Mary."

doc.add_paragraph(
    "The investigation began by listening to the raw 'war-intercept.wav' file. "
    "Immediately, two extremely loud, continuous screeching tones were apparent, "
    "completely drowning out any speech. "
    "The first step was to quantify exactly what was happening using digital signal analysis.\n\n"
    "A Full-Band FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) was computed on the entire 4 minute 39 second "
    "recording. The FFT decomposes the audio from the Time Domain (a waveform showing "
    "amplitude over time) into the Frequency Domain (a spectrum showing which frequencies "
    "are present and at what volume). "
    "The result was unambiguous: two massive sharp spikes dominated the spectrum at exactly "
    "700 Hz and 2600 Hz, with smaller echo-spikes at their harmonics (1400 Hz, 2800 Hz, 4200 Hz). "
    "The mathematical precision of these peaks — perfectly integer multiples of each other — "
    "confirmed this was deliberate, synthetic CW (Continuous Wave) jamming injected into "
    "the recording, not natural environmental noise."

    "Multiple alternative hypotheses were systematically tested and ruled out to ensure "
    "the correct approach was identified:"

# --- Finding ---
doc.add_heading("Finding", level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The audio was confirmed to contain a human voice recording (a personal letter) that "
    "had been intentionally obscured by two Continuous Wave (CW) jamming tones injected at "
    "700 Hz and 2600 Hz. These two frequencies are historically significant:\n"
    "• 700 Hz is a standard AM radio carrier test frequency used in broadcast engineering.\n"
    "• 2600 Hz is the same frequency famously exploited by 1960s phone phreakers to manipulate "
    "analog telephone systems, suggesting a technically sophisticated adversary.\n\n"
    "The key forensic finding was the nature of the noise itself. Standard IIR Notch Filters "
    "(used in earlier attempts) would remove the tones, but the extreme sharpness required "
    "caused the filter to physically 'ring' — like flicking a glass. This produced a new "
    "artifact: a lingering metallic resonance that replaced the original buzz. "
    "The solution required a paradigm shift away from time-domain filtering entirely, "
    "to STFT Spectral Deletion (frequency-domain erasure)."

    "This single script executes a complete 4-stage audio processing pipeline automatically:\n\n"
    "Stage A — STFT Spectral Deletion:\n"
    "Instead of using traditional IIR Notch Filters (which cause 'ringing' artifacts), the audio "
    "is converted into a 2D spectrogram image using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). "
    "The specific frequency bins corresponding to the jamming tones (690-710Hz, 1390-1410Hz, "
    "2590-2610Hz, 2790-2810Hz, 4190-4210Hz) are located in the image and their amplitude "
    "is reduced to 0.1% of original (effectively deleted). The spectrogram is then "
    "converted back to audio using the inverse STFT (iSTFT). Because we erased the frequencies "
    "as image pixels rather than using a resonating filter, no ringing artifacts are produced.\n\n"
    "Stage B — AI Spectral Noise Reduction:\n"
    "The noisereduce library analyzes the audio to learn the 'fingerprint' of the background "
    "tape hiss, then subtracts it from the entire file, leaving only the voice signal.\n\n"
    "Stage C — Speech Bandpass Filter:\n"
    "A Butterworth Bandpass Filter (300Hz - 3400Hz) removes any sub-bass rumble below "
    "and ultra-high electronic whining above the range of normal human speech.\n\n"
    "Stage D — Extreme Voice Boost:\n"
    "A 15x amplification is applied via a hyperbolic tangent curve (tanh), which acts "
    "as a smart amplifier — aggressively boosting quiet whispers while safely soft-clipping "
    "loud passages to prevent distortion."
